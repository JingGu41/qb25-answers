section 1.3 

What does the PCA plot suggest to you about the data? Why?
there is no clustersing between the tissue's 3 replicates and different tissue are clustered together rather than the separation, even the highest variant component is not separating the point enough into distant clusters 

Fix any problems that the PCA reveals.
the tissue naming looks weird 

What feature explains the first principal component (simply saying “tissue” is not sufficient)?
how the most variable gene are differently expressed across the tissues, likely to do the different regulation due to context from the environment

section 3
the categories of enrichments make sense because cluster 4 genes are mainly involve in the metabolic process for macromolecules, nucleobase, RNA because the sample is retrieved from the midgut 

for cluster 6 genes, its mainly involved in ubiquitination catabolic process, it make sense because ubquitination and degradation is vital cellular process and can be differently regualted in different section of the gut.
