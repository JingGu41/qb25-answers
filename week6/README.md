section 1.3 

What does the PCA plot suggest to you about the data? Why?
there is clear clustersing between the tissue's 3 replicates and different tissue are clustered together along the x axis following the ingetion progression og the gut 

Fix any problems that the PCA reveals.
there is a mix of the color of the iron, and the large flat cell iron need to switch the column in the matrix in order to fixed the issue 

What feature explains the first principal component (simply saying “tissue” is not sufficient)?
how the most variable gene are differently expressed across the tissues, likely to do the different regulation due to context from the environment, there can be different microbial clony along the digestive track. 

section 3
the categories of enrichments make sense because cluster 4 genes are mainly involve in the metabolic process for macromolecules, nucleobase, RNA because the sample is retrieved from the midgut 

for cluster 6 genes, its mainly involved in ubiquitination catabolic process, it make sense because ubquitination and degradation is vital cellular process and can be differently regualted in different section of the gut.
