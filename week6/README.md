section 1.3 

What does the PCA plot suggest to you about the data? Why?
there is no clustersing between the tissue's 3 replicates and different tissue are clustered together rather than the separation, even the highest variant component is not separating the point enough into distant clusters 

Fix any problems that the PCA reveals.
the tissue naming looks weird 

What feature explains the first principal component (simply saying “tissue” is not sufficient)?
how the most variable gene are differently expressed across the tissues, likely to do the different regulation due to context from the environment
